# Nord-on-mac
A collection of all my config files to make your mac environment Nord themed as much as possible. 

A lot of the configs are borrowed from other users. I claim no credit for having done anything on here. I just wanted to make available to others what I wish was out there for documentation when I set out to rice my macOS. I am running ventura 13.2.1 on a 2021 macbook pro m1.

Installation 

1. Window manager: yabai

  To install follow this set of instructions from yabai's github. https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Installing-yabai-(latest-release)
  I chose to make my SIP disabled to run all the fun parts of yabai like window transparency and removing shadows. I do not recommend either way it is up to your personal preference. 
  
2. Desktop Bar: sketchybar
  To install follow this set of instructions from sketchybars github. https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/setup

3. Terminal: iterm2 + oh-my-zsh + powerlevel10k + neofetch
  install links: https://iterm2.com/ https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k
  I added a to my .zshrc file a script that runs neofetch each time you open a terminal, to do the same run brew install neofetch 
  
4. Browser: Firefox
  There are options out there to make fully custom css for firefox, a good place to learn more about it is the firefoxCSS reddit.
  I chose to keep it simple and just use one of the prebuilt theme extensions firefox provides. 

5. Spotify + spicetify: https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started 
  The nord theme can be found on the marketplace after you get spicetify working with spotify

6. Notion Enhanced: https://notion-enhancer.github.io/getting-started/installation/ 
  Notion makes it a pain to find the marketplace at the moment. A workaround I found is by going on Notion Enhanced desktop app and pressing opt + command + i from there you type in the console __enhancerElectronApi.focusMenu() this will take you to the marketplace where you can add the nord theme to notion.
